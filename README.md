# Prodigy_DS_Task1
Problem Statement - Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 

# Dataset
The dataset used for this task is [worldpopulationdata.csv](https://github.com/Renissa/Prodigy_DS_Task1/blob/0f3d5a22fb307c092b4829c2cca8f8db32acb5f6/worldpopulationdata.csv) . This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

# Key skills include
1. Data Cleaning: Identifying and resolving missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to maintain accurate datasets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained proficiency in using visual tools such as bar charts and histograms to analyze data distributions, trends, and patterns.

Through Task 1, I improved my ability to create visualizations that make it easier to understand datasets, particularly in areas like population demographics, helping to extract valuable insightsÂ quickly.
